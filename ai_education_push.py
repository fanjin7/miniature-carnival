"""Dedicated AI-prioritized teaching and teacher literacy literature push.

This entrypoint reuses the main Academic Daily Scholar pipeline, but narrows the
special push toward teaching-related studies and teacher literacy/development
studies. Preschool, primary school, and junior-high/lower-secondary studies are
especially preferred, but the topic gate also accepts AI-assisted teaching,
subject-specific AI integration, teacher digital/AI/intelligent/data literacy,
AI integration in preservice and in-service teacher education, and teaching or
teacher-role change under educational digital transformation. The search window
is three years. Selection is ranked primarily by topic relevance, not by whether
the paper was published today.
